After unzipping you may notice that there are multiple .java files and classes.
The "Fractal.java" file contains the main method that the fractal drawing relies on. 
This code, along with everything else in the .zip file (with the exception of the Canvas.java file) was written on the IDE IntelliJ IDEA.

Please run the Fractal.java class, it should prompt the user to enter the shape they want to see when ran. Inside the Fractal class you will notice a switch statement in the main method. The switch statement doesn't make the user input case specific, as long as none of the inputs contain capitalized letters that aren't the first (i.e. "Triangle" and "triangle" work, but "TrIangle" will not work).

Inside the code, there are also comments that detail my thought process, and shape patterns.

Note: The employment of random colors is used in the fractalCircle() method, so at times (very slim chance), the smaller circles will be the same shade as the initial circle, making it impossible to see them. If this is the case, please try again, the colors will change each time.

Thank you very much.

Best,
Charlie
